# LinearRegression
Implementation of Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression. 
I have used validation_curve from sklearn library to find which degree of polynomial equation can best fit the data as well have a good validation accuracy
The validation curve is used for viewing the score over a varying range of hyper-parameters, a learning curve is used for finding out whether an estimator would benefit from more data, once if a particular model converges, adding more training data would not help.
I have fine tuned the model using GridSearchCV.
